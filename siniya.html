<h2>Message from the Principal</h2>
<p> At the beginning of the new academic year 2017-18, let me extend my best wishes to the staff and students (current and the prospective ones)! Recently, some of our alumni made us proud by securing high rank in the All India Civil Services Exam 2017, M. Tech Exam of Kerala University, Best Entreprenuer Challenege, etc., signalling that many of the good beginnings made are now reaching their logical conclusions. Progress has been made by way of improved infrastructure, new schemes implemented, etc.

We need to diligently pursue them to sustain the good results. Along with the starting of the new EEE branch, a PhD program also has been started in CSE under APJKTU. Research-oriented academic culture has to be strengthened along with nurturing the startup ecosystem, which alone is the way forward. This year, we could host Online examinations for an outside agency and we are bound to get wider attention. This must be reciprocated with academic excellence.

On the infrastructural aspect, the construction work for the Boys hostel is in full swing. Administrative sanctions for the Staff Hostel and new Electrical Engineering Block have been received and the construction will begin soon. An integrated sports complex is on the anvil. Steps for getting ISO certification have been initiated. A master plan to upgrade the institution to a Center of Excellence has been submitted for the Government's approval. </p>
